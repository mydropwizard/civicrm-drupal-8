CiviCRM Drupal 8 Module
=======================

This is a beta version of the integration module required to allow CiviCRM and 
Drupal 8 to work together.

Creating a new Drupal 8 site
----------------------------

To setup a new Drupal 8 installation with CiviCRM, there is a convenient
Composer template. This is the easiest way to get started for evaluating
CiviCRM on Drupal 8 or participating in development.

Adding to an existing site
--------------------------

Installing CiviCRM on Drupal 8 requires Composer, so your Drupal 8 site needs
to be fully 'Composerized', ie. starting from the
[drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)
Composer template.

Assuming that is the case, there is a convenient Composer plugin than can
easily install CiviCRM to your Drupal 8 site.
